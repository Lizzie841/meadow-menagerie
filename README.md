# Meadow Menagerie
a story gamemode for Rain Meadow, which allows you to play and progress as non-slugcat creatures
wip, but atm survivor and probably monk's campaigns are mostly supported, with the exception of ascension currently being impossible, and most other campaigns are partially supported.
for non-surv campaigns, you'll likely need to switch to a slugcat for key progression points, but echoes, most iterator interactions, and ascending (not for arti or saint) will all work without needing to be a slugcat
watcher campaign is not at all supported

current playable creatures:
all the creatures in meadow's meadow gamemode (lizards, scavengers, lantern mice, squidcadas, eggbugs, noodleflies)
jetfish
yeeks (partially, very buggy so needs to be enabled)

feel free to contribute! a lot of the work for this is pretty painful, so i definitely wouldn't mind some help :P
if you wanna help, but don't know how to or don't want to make pull requests, feel free to dm me on discord instead
